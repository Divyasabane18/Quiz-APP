### 🔧 To Use:
1. Save this as `README.md`.
2. Replace `your-username` in the Git URL.
3. Add a `screenshot.png` in your repo if you want a preview.
4. Create a `LICENSE` file if you want (MIT is usually fine).

Would you like me to help you write the `index.html`, `style.css`, or prepare this for hosting on GitHub Pages too?
